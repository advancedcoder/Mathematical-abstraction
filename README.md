Sets 
Program can perform operations on sets like union, intersection and difference. Also it can compare two sets. 
For instance, first set is less than second, when number of elements is less then number of elements of the second 
set, and it is a subset of the second set. Program also has an overloaded explicit operator double, that returns 
the sum of the set and an overloaded implicit operator string that returns the set.
